# Weather-Data-Bangladesh-1901-2019
The dataset consists every month's average temperature and average rainfall from 1901 to 2019 of Bangladesh. The PDF file has the entire analysis project. Some of the visual analysis can not be done in excel hence was done with python, and because I don't know much python, I took Chatgpt's help to do the python coding for me.
